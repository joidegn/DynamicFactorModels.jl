### Dynamic Factor Models for Julia
[Dynamic factor models] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_factor) or diffusion index models are econometric models which allow the estimation of a dependent variable using potentially very many regressors.


## Installation
This package is not registered as a Julia package (yet) as it is in an unfinished state. You have been warned. You can install it using 
```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("git://github.com/joidegn/DynamicFactorModels.jl.git")
```

## Features
*Simulate and Estimate Dynamic factor models
*Preselect predictors using soft and hard thresholding (see Bai, Jushan, and Serena Ng. "Forecasting economic time series using targeted predictors." Journal of Econometrics 146.2 (2008): 304-317.)
